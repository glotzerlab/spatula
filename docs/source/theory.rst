Crystals
--------

Notes on point group, wyckoff sites and space group. So in crystals there are basically
2 types of symmetry elements - ones that have translation in them: glide planes and
screw axis. glide planes are plane symmetry + translation while screw axis are rotation
+ translation. Crystal has a space and a point group associated with it. The point group
of the crystal is determined with respect to the center of the crystal (it doesnt matter
weather or not there is a particle there). The wyckoff sites have an associated site
symmetry in the form of a point group which MUST BE a subgroup of the point group of the
crystal, depending on where it sits. If it sits at many symmetry axises/planes it will
in general have high point group symmetry. If it doesnt sit on any symmetry elemtn it
might have no (point group) symmetry associated with wyckoff site. So PGOP can determine
the symmetry of the wyckof site. To determine the symmetry of the crystal one probably
has to apply it to diffraction - center of diffraction should be equivalent to the
center of the crystal. 
Add some examples add some figures/images to explain this.
